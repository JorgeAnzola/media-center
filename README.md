# Requirements
- Docker Compose


# Getting started

Clone or download this repo into your home folder.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/JorgeAnzola/media-center.git (or download the [latest release](https://github.com/JorgeAnzola/media-center/releases/latest/download/media-center.zip))
cd media-center
cp docker-compose.yaml.example docker-compose.yaml
```

## Configuration
If you've cloned the repo in a folder different than `~/media-center/` you'd need to double check a couple of things in the newly created `docker-compose.yaml` file before booting up.
You need to make sure all the `/data` paths (like `/data/torrents/` and `/data/media/movies`) are pointing to the right folders. 

## Booting up

```
cd ~/media-center
docker-compose up -d
```

## Automatic start
You'd probably like your media center to start automatically after restarting.
To do that

```
crontab -e
```

and add the following line

```
@reboot docker-compose -f ~/media-center/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

# Going extra
You will now have 6 software running on your system or server.
You can use an app dashboard like [Homer](https://github.com/JorgeAnzola/homer-dashboard).
